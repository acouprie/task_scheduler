### Simulation of Task Scheduling 

In the context of Resource Management, the subject is to develop a simple simulator for simulating what happens when scheduling batch tasks and periodic tasks on a parallel platform. 

The code can be written in any language (C/Java/Python/â€¦). 

The code should be versatile, to change easily its parameters. 

The input (static or dynamic) of the simulator will be : 

- a test file, describing the experiment to be done : the server file, the job file, the dependency file (if any), the number of times periodic tasks will repeat, the power cap, the energy cap

- a file with a list of tasks (periodic, aperiodic) with their properties (arrival date, units of work, deadline, period). 

- a file with a list of servers (performance, frequencies)

- a file with a list of dependencies between tasks

The schedulers to implement are : 

1) Schedulers without taking dependencies into account 

- FIFO (adapted to handle power/energy caps) 
- First Fit (jobs and servers are sorted on the parameter of your choice) 
- Energy-aware EDF (http://www.cecs.uci.edu/technical_report/TR02-24.pdf, using CSMS or CSS, your choice) 

2) Schedulers taking dependencies into account 

- WaVefront scheduler (as early as possible) (https://parasol.tamu.edu/groups/amatogroup/research/scheduling/scheduling_algorithms/)

- CPM (Cluster Path Merge) (https://parasol.tamu.edu/groups/amatogroup/research/scheduling/scheduling_algorithms/)


The output of the simulator : For each of the scheduler : 

- the obtained schedule (starting time and end time for each task, on which server). The format of the output file is :

#jobID serverID starting_time ending_time 

-Metrics (the power along time with a graph, final energy of the schedule, missed deadline, makespan) 


Power model : Let f be a given frequency, and fMax be the maximum frequency of a server. We call s the slowdown of the server when running at frequency f (e.g. s = f/fMax). 

If a task runs on a server, the power is approximated by : P(s) = Pmax * s^2 

We consider that Pmax = 200 Watts. 

Execution model : duration of a task is w, at frequency 1, on a server with performance 1. If a server is running at frequency f, the duration is w/f. If a server is having a performance 2, the duration is w/2 at frequency 1. If a server with performance 2 is running at frequency f, the duration is (w/2)/f.

In the source file that is requested, you must comment and argue your choices. 

The final result is : 

- a set of source files. 
- a report with the metrics and graphs, and a table comparing the different algorithm.
